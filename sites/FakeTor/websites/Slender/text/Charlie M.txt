I see people everywhere, who remind me of the man I could have become. They understand the rules so well. It's like the rules of the great game of life were never taught to me. Everything I ever worked towards is gone. Everything I loved has been taken away from me. I'm an empty shell of a man. Living in this world of constant noise. Failure after failure. No one left to love. No one left to love me back. This world is noting but noise now! And I can't understand any of it! I see everyone wading through the noise like they are part of it, familiar with it. While I struggle and drown as some unwanted outsider. None of it makes sense. And I'm alone in it all. No more job. No more family. I can never re-build it all. I'm a hopeless excuse for a man. I need to get out. Imagine being trapped in a game where you don't understand the rules, clumsily trying to understand how to make it through. But you can't. You can't progress. I thought I knew the rules, but it was a lie. You see everyone else wizzing by like it's so easy. And no one tells me! No one cares about my game. I'm alone in this forsaken nightmare! Because I don't belong in it! I need to log off. I need to get out of it. I need to rest. I need tranquillity. I need to feel like I belong somewhere. I@m not sorry for this because I don't owe this damn world anthing, and I can never forgive life. So goodbye, and good luck with your own game.
