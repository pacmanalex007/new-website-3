            <h1 class="card-title">You have been scammed!</h1>
            <h2 class="card-title" style="font-size:20px;">Heya guys, I'd like to thank you very much.</h2>
            <p class="card-text">You have been visiting my scamming sites over the last 4 years and gave me the possibility to collect more than 200 BTC just out of nothing...</p>
            <p class="card-text">I never expected that amount of payments - really - are you all stupid? Is really nobody verifying the URLs they're on?</p>
            <p class="card-text">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="card-text">Anyway, every story has an end, and every software should have an end of life before it gets blown up.</p>
            <p class="card-text">This scamming network served more than 800 onion domains on 20 front-end servers with about 5kk hits per day</p>
            <p class="card-text">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="card-text">I'm pretty sure there are some guys out there who are really pissed off - I'd be if I lost 20k$ on a scamming site :D (and thats not a exception)</p>
            <p class="card-text">And I'm also pretty sure my fully self written proxy software with external payment processor is not bug free. </p>
            <p class="card-text">It was indeed a boredom project which was never expected to be that "successful" - or better "profitable"?</p>
            <p class="card-text">The software ore one of the servers will be hacked or seized at some time and I really don't want to be doxxed.</p>
            <p class="card-text">&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="card-text">So I'm going to retire now. As a small farewell gift I'll tell you the right URL of the site you've just tried to visit:</p>
