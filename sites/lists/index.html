      <pre style="font-size:1.1em;color:white;text-align:center;font-family:Arial;">
        And now for my favourite TV shows. I was going to put this in the "Movies" list but thought against that so it has it's own category.
  
        But here's the short version, a Top 5: [All links below go to The Movie DB :)]
        1. <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/73107-barry/season/3/episode/8" style="color:lightblue;" target="_blank">Barry: Season 3, Episode 8 [Season Finale] - Starting Now</a> <b>||</b>
        Holy fucking shit, this was one of THE BEST finales to any show I've ever seen. For a show that is a mix between actions and comedy with seriousness and.. comedy..ness, Bill Hader and Alec Berg have made something utterly incredible. But man, this fucking season finale was no laughing matter whatsoever.
        I was more shocked at this season finale than I was at the Better Call Saul mid-season finale, which was just bad. This entire finale was better than the entire first half of Season 6 of Better Call Saul. The fact they spent the entire first half fucking over Howard and then just axe him 5 episodes later. What the actual fuck was the point.
        Also. It was either this or I believe it was the previous episode. Whichever one had that fucking amazing sequence with the biker guys that go after Barry and try to kill him and the fucking scene was phenomenal.
        2. <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/76479-the-boys/season/3/episode/4" style="color:lightblue;" target="_blank">The Boys: Season 3, Episode 4: Glorious Five Year Plan</a> <b>||</b>
        I was torn between this episode of the season premiere. If you know, you fucking know. But I believe this'll change as the season goes on. Season is stil on-going with the next episode dropping on Prime Video tomorrow (17-06-2022). So far, very good season, with a trio to open the season.
        3. <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/85021-gangs-of-london/season/1/episode/1" style="color:lightblue;" target="_blank">Gangs of London: Season 1, Episode 1</a> <b>||</b>
        Now that's how you open up a show. Hell, everything up until the title card is tense as fuck then after that. Even more so.. The show is fucking incredible. Created by Gareth Evans, director of the great The Raid and The Raid 2 films, Merantau & Apostle (Netflix Original). And has a upcoming film, Havoc coming to Netflix I believe this year or next. 
        4. <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/60574-peaky-blinders/season/6/episode/5" style="color:lightblue;" target="_blank">Peaky Blinders: Season 6, Episode 5</a> <b>||</b> 
        Tbh. It was hard to really pick an episode from Season 6 because the entire season was fucking outstanding, from the camera work, the brilliant acting from everyone and just. Every episode had something amazing in them so this will be a doubler, Episode 5 and the finale Episode 6.
        5. <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/79410-after-life/season/3/episode/6" style="color:lightblue;" target="_blank">After Life: Season 3, Episode 6</a> <b>||</b>
        If I'm being really honest, I could've just listed every episode from Seasons 1, 2 and 3 because they're all so fucking good, well written and well directed by Ricky. But the finale of Season 3 was so fucking good, so well written directed and everything. Just absolute brilliance. Highly recommend the entire show.

          Here is a list of YouTubers I like, enjoy and watch. But, this list may and will probably change a lot because over time I lose interest in YouTubers I watch / used to watch.

           If you couldn't tell by the title of his channel, he's a food reviewer, he goes to places in the UK (I think he just does the UK I'm not sure if he plans to do outside the UK but eh)
           and goes to places that people in the comments of his videos who are mainly British, tell him to go to like great places, famous places etc etc. Highly recommend his channel
